Approach taken when building: Testing was very important. First I generated a scaffold of 'posts'. The next step test via CURL scripts to ensure functionality. Once this was completed I was able to move to the front end and create proper client interactions to access the database.

API routes:

* One to many --> posts
* posts belong to user
* user has many posts

Technologies used:

HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, JSON, AJAX, Git, GitHub, Grunt, Rails, Sass, Bootstrap, Handlebars, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Rails Console, Node console(testing), Pry(testing).

Unsolved problems: Incorporating the use of YouTube will be needed on future iterations of this proof of concept project. API calls will be required to pull the correct content and display it in an iframe on the front end.
